# TC3006 
This repository is a demo of what is expected to deliver on each repository requested for the TC3006 course at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. For this demo, we consider the *implementation portfolio* deliverable, which spans across two modules (Statistics and ML) and two subcompetencies (SMA0101A and SMA0401A). Also, we assume that the repository is being provided at the end of first block, which means that the students already got some feedback from the professors. 

## Structure of this repository
The root folder of this repository contains the following files and folders: 

* **Files**
  * README.md: This file  
* **Folders**
  * final: Folder with the information about the final deliverables, which include the changes that the reviewers asked for
  * retro: Folder with the information about the draft version of each deliverable, which are provided for requesting feedback

## Files for revision
Following is a list of the files that must be checked for grading each subcompetency: 

* *Module 1: Statistics*
	* *SMA0101A*
		* **Evidence 01: Modeling** 
* *Module 2: Machine Learning*
	* *SMA0401A*
		* **Evidence 01: ML from scratch** 
		* **Evidence 02: ML from a framework**
